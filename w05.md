# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Memory Hierarchy Design and its Characteristics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/)<br>
Remember when we learn about memory hierarchy in Introduction to Computer Organization course?
This gfg article sums it up as short as possible.

2. [Definition: Cache Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cache-memory)<br>
This link answers what is the definition of cache memory, what are its type, etc.
It also explain other stuff like locality, performance, and comparison between cache, memory, and virtual memory.

3. [Memory Allocation Techniques](https://www.memorymanagement.org/mmref/alloc.html)<br>
Just like the title, this link explains about different kinds of memory allocation techniques.

4. [Demand Paging](http://ftp.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-2/ch05s02.html)<br>
This link gives explanation about demand paging and its scheme for valid bits.

5. [Paging Implementation](https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-implementation/)<br>
A very long blog post of in-depth explanation of paging implementation.

6. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Another gfg article and this time is for page replacement algorithms.
This article give example about different kind of algorithms such as FIFO (and the Belady's Anomaly), Optimal Page replacement and LRU.
Sadly, this article doesnt explain about LFU and MFU.

7. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
I cant find other good source that explain about what is thrashing and how to handle it, so here is another gfg article.

8. [Memory Management with Buddy Allocator and Slab Allocator](https://students.mimuw.edu.pl/ZSO/Wyklady/06_memory2/BuddySlabAllocator.pdf)<br>
A slide that explains about the implementation of buddy system allocator and slab allocator.

9. [How to Use the Linux top Command (and Understand Its Output)](https://www.howtogeek.com/668986/how-to-use-the-linux-top-command-and-understand-its-output/)<br>
A good source for learning how to use the top command. 

10. [Bad apple on task manager.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBeI30ccb6g)<br>
Since we are talking about top (table of process) which is a task manager program, here is bad apple played on windows task manager.
