6. [TestDisk Step by Step](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step)<br>
Yesterday, i lost a whole disk partition on my external hard drive.
My external hard drive is actually a hard drive from my old computer that i put in a hard drive enclosure.
So here's the story.<br><br>
My father brought home his business place's cctv video recorder that was recovered from a flood.
He wondered if the recorder and its hard drive inside it still works, he took it apart and told me to 
try to use the hard drive on the enclosure that i used on my old hard drive.
So i put it in my enclosure and plug it into my laptop while he put some of the recorder parts back and plugged it into power to see if it can still turn on.
My laptop cannot read the hard drive and silly me thought it was broken because of the flood 
(i later found out it just have different type of filesystem, thus having different type of partition).
Then, i brought it back to my father and told him that it is broken.
The recorder actually still works and he told me to plug my old hard drive into the recorder.
I plugged it in and the recorder cannot read my old hard drive (what a surprise).
Then i plugged in the recorder's hard drive and the recorder detected it.
My father then did a few test on it and the whole thing can still work.
Maybe its because the flood doesnt actually reach the recorder.
After we are done with this recorder thing, i got back into my room and plugged my old hard drive into my laptop.<br><br>
My laptop cannot read the hard drive and when i checked the disk management menu, there was no partition in it.
I internally screamed "Oh no".
Then i do some GSGS and my dumb brain finally realized that my old hard drive and the video recorder hard drive have different type of filesystem and partition.
Also, i found this free open-source software that i can use to recover lost partition (and recover some file).
Its a good thing that this software exist and i definitely recommend you to use it if you ever lost your partition or files for some reason.
I also feel grateful that i learned about filesystem and partition beforehand because otherwise 
i would probably went with buying some "premium" paid-software that basically do the same job except its paid.<br><br>
After all that losing partition stuff is cleared, i then wondered why recovery is possible.
Onto the next link.

7. [Where do deleted files go?](https://www.quora.com/Where-do-deleted-files-go-1)<br>
The answer given in this quora question explain about some stuff that happened when you delete a file.
The deleted file doesnt actually just go away after you delete it and this is why file recovery is possible.
I also found a video that explained about it, here is the video: ["Where Do Deleted Files Go?" by VSauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5s4-Kak49o).

8. [An introduction to Linux Access Control Lists (ACLs)](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-access-control-lists)<br>
When you type `ls -l` you can see something like `-rwxr-xr-x` at the most left of a file.
If we are a beginner probably we dont know anything about it and just ignore it.
This `-rwxr-xr-x` thing is actually the file permission based on user, group, and others.
This article gives you some basic explanation on how you can view and edit a permission.

9. [Hard Disk Drive Basics](http://ntfs.com/hard-disk-basics.htm)<br>
Since we are talking a about filesystems, we might as well learn how the hard drive works.
This documentation tells you how it works and there are more topics in the next pages.

10. [How to Mount and Unmount File Systems in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)<br>
This is a guide on how to mount (and unmount) file systems in linux.
